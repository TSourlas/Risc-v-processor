Assignments Overview:

Assignment 1: Implement a 32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The ALU must perform signed addition, subtraction, logical operations (AND, OR, XOR), comparisons, and various shifts. This ALU will be used in subsequent assignments.

Assignment 2: Design a calculator circuit using the ALU from Assignment 1. The calculator includes a 16-bit accumulator register and must support all ALU operations. It operates based on input switches and buttons.

Assignment 3: Implement a register file for the RISC-V processor. It should contain 32 registers of 32-bit width, support simultaneous reading from two registers, and writing to one register. All registers are initially set to zero.

Assignment 4: Design the datapath for a RISC-V processor. The datapath should integrate the ALU, register file, and other components to handle instruction types such as arithmetic, memory access, and branches.

Assignment 5: Create a control unit (FSM) to manage the execution of RISC-V instructions in five stages: Instruction Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory Access, and Write Back. Integrate the datapath and control unit to form a complete processor capable of executing instructions.
